          Hi, I'm <span className="font-semibold">Drey</span> — a passionate front-end developer who loves building beautiful, clean, and responsive websites.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I started my journey in tech as a self-learner, and I’ve worked on several projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and now, I’m learning Next.js!
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          I love helping businesses bring their ideas to life with code. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring design ideas, learning new tech, or chilling with movies.
