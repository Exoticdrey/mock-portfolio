          I started my journey in tech as a self-learner, and I&apos;ve worked on several projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and now, I&apos;m learning Next.js!

          I love helping businesses bring their ideas to life with code. When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me exploring design ideas, learning new tech, or chilling with movies.
